			<p>I am currently teaching myself web development and web design. Although we have only recently been introduced it was an instant love. I spend almost all my spare time trying out new CSS I have learnt and following online tutorials, it has given me a drive to progress more than any other subject ever has. I have been in a few positions such as a Support Worker, Barista, Wildlife Presenter and Activities Coordinator and although these positions have been wonderful I still feel I am not challenged enough. I love problem solving and being tested; maths has been one of my favourite subjects since I was a child. The excitement, frustration and sense of achievement when solving an equation is what I thrive on and I definitely have the same feeling whilst coding!</p>
